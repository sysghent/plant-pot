# Overview of electrical components

This exercise introduces all the different (electrical) components that you will use in this workshop.

We will start by making a small setup with only a minimal amount of required components. This will not yet be a functional pump or plant pot. We will complete the setup gradually in the next exercises.

_*Remark*: If you already have some experience with electronics, you can skip this section._

The core of this project is a Pico W 2 microcontroller. To know how to connect jumper cables (in general), you need to have a quick look first at its ["pin-out" diagram](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-2-w-pinout.pdf).
