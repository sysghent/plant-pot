# Comparison with C and Python

If you prefer Python, you can install `micropython` on the Pico.

Read the [official documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/rp2/quickref.html) for more information on how to get started with `micropython` on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

The `thonny` IDE can be used to send Python commands to a (relatively small) Python interpreter running on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. You can just select the Pico device in the bottom right corner and press run.

This looks easier than Rust, but it may be less efficient or scalable compared to Rust.
