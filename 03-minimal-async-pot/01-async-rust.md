# Async Rust

Not possible to explain everything here, but there are some good books:

- For an introduction, see [Programming Rust](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590)
- For a more in-depth tutorial in how async Rust works and coroutines, have a look at [Asynchronous programming in Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/en-mt/product/asynchronous-programming-in-rust-9781805128137).
