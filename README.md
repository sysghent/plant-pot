## Requisites

Please bring:

- Laptop
- USB-micro cable
- Water container (e.g. a cup of water)
- Some interest in or experience with programming (Rust)

It would be great if you already have set-up the Rust compiler on a Linux system.

## Provided

You can borrow/buy from us (or bring your own):

- Raspberry Pico 2 W
- Analogue capacitive humidity sensor
- 5V water pump
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- LED
- MOSFET transistor
- resistor

If you bring your own board, please pick one with [Embassy support](https://embassy.dev/book/#_getting_a_board_with_examples) or an official HAL.

You can buy the hardware from us at the end of the workshop.

## Homework

After the workshop, you will still need to do some small steps to finish the project:
