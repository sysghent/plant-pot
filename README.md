# Workshop: make a smart plant pot

_(Notes for a workshop organised by Hugo & Willem in Ghent on 4th of June 2025.)_

In this workshop you will learn how to create a plant pot that can automatically add water to itself when the humidity of the earth in the pot is too dry.

Please bring:

- A laptop with a working Rust installation (see below).
- A Micro-USB or USB-C cable
- A water container (e.g. a cup of water).

You can borrow/buy from us:

- Raspberry Pico H / Pico W / ESP32C6 
- Analogue capacitive humidity sensor
- Small 5V water pump
- Small breadboard
- Jumper wires

After the workshop, you will still need to:

- Buy a plant
- Buy tubes to connect the pump to the plant pot

## Schedule


The workshop is divided into parts:

1. Introduction to embedded hardware.
2. Introduction to embedded software.
