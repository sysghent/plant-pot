# Workshop: make a smart plant pot

(Notes for a workshop organised by Hugo & Willem in Ghent on 4th of June 2025.)

In this workshop you will learn how to create a plant pot that can automatically add water to itself when the humidity of the earth in the pot is too dry.

## Requisites

Please bring:

- A laptop (preferably with `rustup` installed).
- A USB-C cable
- A water container (e.g. a cup of water).

Nice, but not required, read:

- Embassy book <https://embassy.dev/book/#_for_beginners>
- Rust book <https://doc.rust-lang.org/book>

## Provided

You can borrow/buy from us (or bring your own):

- Raspberry Pico 2 W (if you bring your own board, pick one with [Embassy support](https://embassy.dev/book/#_getting_a_board_with_examples))
- Analogue capacitive humidity sensor
- 5V water pump
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Water tubes (TODO: buy in Brico)

You can buy the hardware from us at the end of the workshop.

To follow along, you can follow the structure of the folder [`Workshop`](./workshop/README.md).

- Buy a plant
- Provide a plastic cover for the electronics
- Provide battery power
