# BSP - GPIO

A simple example on how to interact with GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pico using the standard BSP (board support package) library.

## Usage

Connect the correct GPIO pins of the Pico to a LED and a button.

Flash with `cargo run` and observe state changes.

_Remark: the `rp-pico` BSP is more like a HAL._
