# A smart plant pot: hardware overview

This exercise introduces the plant pot project.

Start by assembling the hardware setup.

- Attach USB-C cable between laptop and Pico W 2
- Softly push Pico with pins inside breadboard
- Push LED with legs into breadboard
- Connect with jumper wires:
  - Connect 3.3V power pin of Pico to gutter of breadboard
  - Connect GND pin of Pico to gutter of breadboard
  - Connect LED to gutter of breadboard

The core of this project is a Pico W 2 microcontroller. To know how to connect jumper cables (in general), you need to have a quick look first at its ["pin-out" diagram](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-2-w-pinout.pdf).
