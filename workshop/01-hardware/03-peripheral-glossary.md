## Glossary of Abbreviations

Written with the help of GitHub Copilot:

- **PIO (Programmable Input/Output):** A flexible hardware block that allows custom I/O protocols to be implemented in hardware, offloading tasks from the main CPU. It can be programmed to handle certain tasks faster and more efficiently than the CPU (such as PWM).
- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output):** Pins on a microcontroller that can be configured as either input or output for general digital signals.
- **SIO (Single-cycle Input/Output):** A fast I/O peripheral that allows direct and efficient access to GPIO pins, often used for bit manipulation.
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):** Converts analog signals (like voltage) into digital values that can be processed by the microcontroller.
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit):** A synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet-switched, single-ended, serial communication bus used for connecting low-speed peripherals.
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):** A synchronous serial communication interface used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems.
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter):** A hardware communication protocol that uses asynchronous serial communication with configurable speed.
- **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation):** A technique for getting analog results with digital means, often used for controlling motors, LEDs, and other devices.
- **USB (Universal Serial Bus):** An industry standard for cables, connectors, and protocols for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and devices.
- **Serial:** A general term for communication where data is sent one bit at a time over a single wire or channel. Usually serial communication is done over COM ports (windows) or ttyACM devices (Linux).
- **CDC ACM (Communications Device Class Abstract Control Model):** A USB device class that emulates a serial port over USB, allowing serial communication between a computer and a microcontroller.
