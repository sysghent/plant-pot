# Simple Rust example

There are a few good resources to learn Rust. The best (and simplest) one is the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Hands-on embedded Rust books:

- There is a book for beginners in embedded Rust:  [Rust Discovery Embedded book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery-mb2/). It assumes you have bought a Microbit v2 (20 euros).
- There is also a book about embedded Rust using an STM32 chip: [Embedded Rust book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/).
