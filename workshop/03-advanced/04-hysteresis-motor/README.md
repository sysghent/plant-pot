# Hysteresis motor control

You can switch the pump's motor on and off with a hysteresis controller. This is a simple control loop that turns the pump on when the humidity is below a certain threshold and turns it off when the humidity is above a certain threshold. This is a simple way to control the pump without using a PID controller.
