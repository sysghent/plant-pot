# Tune motor speed with PWM

Change the speed of the pump's motor is not strictly necessary. However, it is common in other projects.

In this project you will find a way to slow down the motor using pulse width modulation (PWM). This is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electrical device by varying the width of the pulses in a pulse train.

The average power delivered to the load is proportional to the duty cycle of the pulse train.
