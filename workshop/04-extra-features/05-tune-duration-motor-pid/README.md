# Change pump duration with PID

A PID controller is a control loop feedback mechanism (or control loop) widely used in industrial control systems. It continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D).

Implement a PID controller to control the pump's motor duration. For this, you will need to find values for P, I, and D. Use the calculated correction value to lengthen or shorten the duration of the pump's motor.
